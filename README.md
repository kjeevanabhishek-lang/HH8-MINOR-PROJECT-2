# Hardware Hacking Lab (Simulation-Based)

### Short Description
A virtual hardware security lab that presents a basic understanding of access control vulnerabilities, as depicted using the Arduino.

## Brief Description
For example, in the project, the use of the online simulator of Arduino to illustrate how insecure hardware logic can allow unauthorized access is demonstrated, where components like the push buttons and the LEDs are used. This entire lab is virtually performed to demonstrate the hardware security and the concepts of ethical hacking.

## Tools Used
- Tinkercad Circuits (Arduino Simulation
- Arduino (Virtual)
- GitHub

### How to Implement
1. Create a new circuit in Tinkercad.
2. Arduino Uno, Breadboard, Button, LED, and Resistor
3. Connect button to pin 2, and LED to pin 13.
4. Upload the Arduino Access Control Code:
5. Start simulation.
6. Press the button and see "Access Granted".
7. Click 'release' button to view 'Access Denied'. 
8. Take screenshots and load them onto GitHub.

## Project Files
- arduino_code/access_control.ino - Arduino simulation code
- lab-experiments.md - Experiment Observations
- screenshots/ – Circuit, code, simulation, and serial output images

## Tips
In - Run experiments only in simulation. - Never use real hardware systems. - Emphasize understanding vulnerabilities and prevention. 

## What You Will Learn 
- Hardware security basics - Arduino logic and handling of inputs - Concepts relating to access control - Ethical practices in cybersecurity.
